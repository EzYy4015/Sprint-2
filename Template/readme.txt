when using the template, the logo might fly away from the navbar for your side i think? use margin-left
in the css to fix this first, i already commented that part in the css

you need the php files in include for your navigation and footer to show (use the same directory, create
a new file called include if u don't have yet)

the css must all be pasted in your css, if duplicate names then u change ur div de name
if u alrdy define a body, just combine both the codes
